# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#1 .Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
# Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
# Used, CTE to acheive this task.

WITH tempTable AS (
    SELECT Spotifydata.artist_name, AVG(Spotifydata.popularity) AS avg_popularity FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY Spotifydata.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag FROM tempTable
WHERE avg_popularity >= 90;

#2. Determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.

SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#3. Top 10 artist by popularity

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
